<!-- 

This file is a configuration modal.
It allows to initialize some widget internal configuration in opposition to the configuration modal (public configuration) (e.g. hpe-hello-world.cfg.html).
This configuration modal will be used by the View Designer (comming in the UOC next version) in order to configure a given instance of this type of widget (e.g hpe-hello-world).
